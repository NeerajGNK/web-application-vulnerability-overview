Summary:  
Hi Security team members,
Usually,if we reset our password on https://example.com/ we got a change password page which asks phone number and verify OTP .
But,i noticed that if we add another number in the request of forget password through burpsuite then the OTP will get to replaced number 

Steps To Reproduce:

1.Navigate to: https://example.com/
2.Then placed an original number and generate OTP.
3. Intercept the request and change the original number to some other number and get the OTP to that number by forwarding the request.
4.Now you will receive the OTP which pretend to be original one .
5.And then changed the password and takeover the account .

 Impact: 
1: It is a critical issue because an attacker can change any users password without any interaction.
2.An attacker can fully takeover any users account.
